            For this project, I used Tensorflow and Logistic Regression to predict whether news was real or fake from a real vs. fake news dataset. This project served as an introduction
            to natural language processing for me, and going through the steps proved very unintuitive, so lots of time was spent on research. After the initial preprocessing of data, I tokenized
            the data, removed stop words, and padded the texts to make each one the same length. Then, I generated word embeddings and then input the embeddings matrix created from the word
            embeddings into my Tensorflow model. As far as the logistic regression model goes, I utilized a TF-IDF vectorizer and then trained and tested the model. Both of these models actually worked 
            out really well and out of my projects, this is the one that had some of the best results.
