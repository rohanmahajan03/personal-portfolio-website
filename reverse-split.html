            The Reverse Split Backtesting Projec was inspired by a losing options play. I had an underlying assumption that a stock's price would go up by my option's expiration date.
            However, the stock had announced a reverse split. I thought nothing of this, and held the position through the reverse split. Unsurprisingly, but surprisingly to me back then,
            the stock went down and my position went against me. A couple of months later, I was thinking back to this trade and particularily how the move went against me on the day of
            the split. So, I decided to see if there was a trend with these stocks that were reverse spliting and giant price drops on the day of the split, and this project represents where I'm at so
            far in terms of backtesting this potential system. However, I am not sure if this system will ever be viable as stocks that reverse split are often hard-to-borrow which means that they have
            high borrowing costs.
