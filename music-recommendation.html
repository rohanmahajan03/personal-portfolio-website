            The Music Recommendation Project is a data-driven project that leverages machine learning and clustering techniques to provide personalized music recommendations. I was inspired to do
            this project because of my love of music, whch sparked an interest in Spotify's algorithm. I then learned that the algorithm made use of what is known as "content based filtering," 
            where Spotify looks at different features within each song and compares it to similar songs in order to recommend songs that are technically similar to songs the user has listened to in the past.
            So, the primary goal of this project was to group songs based on their audio features and genres, allowing users to discover new music that aligns with their preferences.
